## Summary
- Machine learning algorithm that can create an image from a collection of photographs.
- Hoping to create a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) machine learning algorithm.

## Forks
Instagram account to post the generated images.
- Will post daily images based on collections such as landscapes.
- Collect information such as likes and if above a threshold add to collection.
- Create more and more abstract imagery.

Search function to create a collection based on internet images.
- User will be able to type in a search term.
- Script will scrape internet for collection of related images.
- Algorithm will then produce an image based on search.
